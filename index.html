     Hey Raj,
Life isn’t always easy, but remember — tough times don’t last, tough people do. 💥
You’ve got everything it takes to rise higher than your limits. Every challenge you face is just training for your greatness.
Don’t compare yourself with anyone — your journey is yours alone. One step at a time, one win at a time — keep moving, keep believing.

Your future self is already proud of you. 🌟
So get up, show up, and never give up, Raj. The world hasn’t even seen your best yet. 🚀
